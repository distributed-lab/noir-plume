# Plume
Plume is needed to confirm your identity without disclosing your private data, i.e. [zero-knowledge proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof). Plume has another feature: you can send a message from a private group using special group message. For more details visit https://blog.aayushg.com/nullifier/

## How to use?
To use plume, you need 2 32-byte values for r and sk (secret key), and a message of arbitrary length (these values can be randomly generated). You can use the formulas described in the [plume document](https://aayushg.com/thesis.pdf) or [test.sage](tests/test.sage) to calculate the corresponding `msg`, `c`, `s`, `pk`, and `nullifier` values. After that, follow the `Build and Run` instructions to verify that the data is correct.


### Build and Run
1. Install Noir by following [these instructions](https://noir-lang.org/docs/getting_started/installation/).
2. Change [MSG_LEN](src/constants.nr) constant to the length of the message you want to pass to the program.
3. Run `noir check` command.
4. Pass the bytes of your message, `c` and `s` constants, `nullifier` and `pk` (public key) points in format `[[x_bytes], [y_bytes]]` to the `Prover.toml` file generated by the compiler.
5. Run `noir prove` command to get `plume.proof` file in `proofs` directory.

## secp256k1_XMD:SHA-256_SSWU_RO_ hash-to-curve in Noir

### Quick overview
Implementation of the hash-to-curve algorithm based on [this description](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve-06.html).  
Checked with the test described [here](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve-13.html#appendix-J.8.1).

### The algorithm
```
hash_to_curve(msg)

Input: msg, an arbitrary-length byte string.
Output: P, a point in the secp256k1 curve.

Steps:
1. u = hash_to_field(msg)
2. Q0 = map_to_curve(u[0])
3. Q1 = map_to_curve(u[1])
4. P = iso_map(Q0) + iso_map(Q1)
5. return P
```

#### hash_to_field
